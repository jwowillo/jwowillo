Documentation for projects at https://github.com/jwowillo.

### Implementation

This website is implemented using [md2web](md2web/) and [trim](trim/). This
allows the static documentation to be recorded as easily reusable markdown
files. It also allows other more interesting and dynamic Applications to exist
under subdomains.

### Subapplication

The current subapplication are:

* [mancalai]({{ mancalai }}): Mancala AI analysis.
* [canvas]({{ canvas}}): Online drawing tool.
